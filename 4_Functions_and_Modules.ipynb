    "# Python 4: Functions and Modules\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. In this section we\n",
    "will learn how to write our own functions and modules, and import them. The main purpose of this part of the tutorial is to show you how to write our own functions and modules and hopefully also why you should do it. The goal is to show you how and why modularisation of the source code is a good programming practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing our own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have used Jupyter notebooks to write Python code. We will now show how to \"package\" this source code into functions. This will allow us to reuse the same code easily multiple times (without having to type it in each time). You can then also import your funtions in other programs. Finally, we will also practice running Python by creating script files and having these executed on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When modularising code, first, you will create module script file. You will then use this script as a script itself. Second, you will create a new script, where you import and use the script you just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword for defining a function is *def*. After that we have the function name followed by any arguments in parenthesis. After that comes the code that the function performs. Input to the function is available in the arguments passed to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below can be found in a script file named `translate_module.py`. You are supposed to fill in some of the code for each function. Hint: you should have most of this code from exercises done previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: any variables defined in the function are not available outside of it. Any results that is created in it must be returned to the outside using the `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script, using `hbb.fna` you created in `3_Reading_and_Writing_files` as the fasta dna input file, `translationtable.txt` as the translation table input file, and then name the output what you feel like. The output file should not already exist in the directory that you are in, but the input file should."
